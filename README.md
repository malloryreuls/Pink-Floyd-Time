# Pink-Floyd-Time

Second exercise of JavaScript 30, https://javascript30.com, we learn to build a ticking clock using CSS and JavaScript.

Basically, we look for the current time and update the hands based on the time we are seeing.

The original exercise creates an animated circle clock in the center of a blue page.  But, when I saw this exercise, I immediately thought of the iconic Pink Floyd song, “Time.” So I customized my app to be a bit more thematic. A few things I added:
- Background image
- Linear hand color gradient
- Changing the shape from a circle to a triangle
- Make the hands move within the triangle on the background image
- Moving the CSS and JS files outside of the index
- Deploying to Heroku (by adding a single line of PHP)

A few things I would want to do next:
- Sync up to current time for PST or current time from the perspective of the viewer.
- Add a footer and add links to repo, Medium article, and Codepen
- Fix weird glitch that happens after 60 seconds
- Mobile?
