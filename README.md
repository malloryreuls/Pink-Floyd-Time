# Pink-Floyd-Time

Second exercise of JavaScript 30, https://javascript30.com, we learn to build a ticking clock using CSS and JavaScript.

We look for the current time and update the hands based on time we are seeing

The original exercise creates an animated circle clock in the center of a blue page. When I saw this exercise, I immediately thought of the Pink Floyd song, "Time." So I wanted to further customize it to be along this theme. Some things I added: 
- Background image
- Linear hand color gradient
- Changing the shape from a circle to a triange
- Make the hands move within the triange on the background image
- Moving the css and js files outside of the index
- Deploying to Heroku (by adding a single line of PHP)

A few things I would want to do next: 
- Sync up to current time for PST, right now it looks like it is set to two hours ahead
- Add links to GitHub repo, medium article, code-pen in footer
- Fix weird glitch that happens after 60 seconds
- Mobile?
